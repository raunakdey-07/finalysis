# Finalysis - Next.js Scaffold

This folder contains a starter Next.js + TypeScript migration scaffold for the Finalysis app.

Quick start:

1. cd finalysis-next
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

The scaffold includes placeholder implementations for fetching financials and CMS content. Replace those with your production integrations in `lib/yahooFinance.ts` and `lib/cms.ts`.
